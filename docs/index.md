This is documentation for the `PyBMKG` project that
is an asynchronous api wrapper written in Python for
[open data](https://data.bmkg.go.id/) on weather
forecasts and latest earthquakes in Indonesia served
by Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency
([BMKG](https://bmkg.go.id/)).

PyBMKG was created as a wrapper to handle API requests
BMKG open data asynchronously. This is because the
available API does not follow API standards in general,
therefore a wrapper was created which is expected to
make it easier to use the BMKG open data API with Python.

We use the third party library [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/)
for asynchronous client requests and it has been tested
to work well using the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
library. Also it use [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
as the schema.

on weather forecasts and latest earthquake information.
